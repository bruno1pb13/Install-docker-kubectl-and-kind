# Install-docker-kubectl-e-kind
Script for quick installation of Docker, Kubectl and kind for linux


## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/bruno1pb13/Install-docker-kubectl-e-kind
cd 'Install-docker-kubectl-e-kind'
chmod +x installBundle.sh
sudo ./installBundle.sh
```

## One line install

### I wanted to put a command to start the installation with one line but it gave an error, if someone can solve it it would help a lot.

```
# don't work
# don't work
# don't work

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruno1pb13/Install-docker-kubectl-e-kind/main/installBundle.sh | sh
```
