# Install-docker-kubectl-and-kind
Script for quick installation of Docker, Kubectl and kind for linux

## One line install


```bash 
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruno1pb13/Install-docker-kubectl-e-kind/main/installBundle.sh -o installBundle.sh && chmod +x installBundle.sh && bash installBundle.sh

# zsh don't work
### I wanted to put a command to start the installation with just one line, but it gave an error. If someone could fix it, it would be greatly appreciated.

```



## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/bruno1pb13/Install-docker-kubectl-e-kind
cd 'Install-docker-kubectl-e-kind'
chmod +x installBundle.sh
sudo ./installBundle.sh
```
